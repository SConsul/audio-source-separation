# Audio Source Separation uing Low Latency Neural Network
This reposiory contains the code for our course project for Machine Learning (CS419) at IIT Bombay. We have used the PyTorch library to construct a neural network
to separate instruments from a music file. We have implemented the paper "[Monoaural Audio Source Separation Using Deep
Convolutional Neural Networks](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/fede/f8eedef76692d805a6a3380159a95b79b4de.pdf)", along with a few modifications and experiments inspired by other papers.
